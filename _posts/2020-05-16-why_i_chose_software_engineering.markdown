> I turn 30 years old next month... what in *world* am I doing starting a new career?

That's what I was asking myself a couple weeks ago. Since then, I've been racking my brain and pulling my hair out in front of my laptop trying to make sure I meet the deadline for the first portion of my online course. And if you're wondering if I've asked myself that same question during those two weeks - the answer is a resounding **yes**... but I have absolutely no intention of quitting.

This isn't because I'm stubborn (which I am) or because I think I'm too good to quit (I don't think I've ever felt more bad at a subject before in my life)... it's because I know what I want.

Earlier this month (May 2020), I listened to Elon Musk talk about his plans for SpaceX (traveling to Mars) and Neuralink (developing implantable brainâ€“machine interfaces) in an interview with Joe Rogan. I was both terrified and inspired... in my lifetime, there is a very intelligent, innovative (not to mention wealthy) person out there literally selling his homes and possessions because he considers them *distractions from getting other people to Mars*. 

Here I am, driving back and forth from my "9 to 5", listening to science-fiction level subject matter that is very close to happening, if not in testing stages already. I started thinking not only what life would be like, but how it would be different...

We already spend drastic amounts of time in front of our phones, computers, and television screens. So much so, that there's scientists constantly studying the effects of this so that we can stay healthy while doing so. There's definitely pros and cons to the Information Age we find ourselves in, but one thing is for certain - humans and technology are going to become increasingly intertwined with each other.

So why drop myself right in the thick of it? 

1.  I can.
2.  I want to.
3.  I believe that there will be a need for people like me that remind us of our own humanity along the way.

**I am a software engineer, and I am ready for the future.**
